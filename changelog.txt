NOTE! A big part of this update is unifing a bunch of items.
For example, the new KubeJS bronze will present a problem if you have a drawer full of bronze ingots in v8.9 and below.
The drawer will still be there but the items will dissapear (but not the number of items).
If you had 2000 bronze ingots in the drawer before v9.0, the drawer will be empty.
But if you forget that the drawer had the bronze in it, you can replace it with netherite.
So, you could accidentally turn a full drawer of bronze ingots into a full drawer of netherite ingots!
